# Disclaimer
This is an unofficial LaTeX template for KCL MSc Projects for the Informatics Department. 

It is derived from the Imperial College London Thesis template (which can be found here: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-natural-sciences/department-of-mathematics/public/study/admissions/pg/msc/math-fin/MScThesisTemplate.zip).

Some changes have been made by Sebastian Zillessen to adapt it to KCL.

Feel free to modify it or adapt it to your requirements. 

I do not give any guarantee on this template that it fullfils the KCL regulations or any other regulations.
